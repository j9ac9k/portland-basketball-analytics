# PortlandBasketball.com Predictive Analytics

Determine the most likely outcome of a recreational or upper skill level league basketball match outcome before it happens based on historical data

## Progression

This repo will contain the software used to develop the statistical and/or machine learning models to predict future outcomes of portland basketball games.  I am not a statistician, or a software developer by trade, I am just a guy that appreciates those trades, has an interest and a very finite amount of experience in those areas.  This is going to be a learning project for me.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome.  My code is far from either optimal or pythonic, so any feedback is greatly appreciated.



##Thank You
 Many thanks to Jesse Freitas and the rest of the Portland Basketball staff for being supportive of this project and supplying the data that will be used to develop the predictive models.
